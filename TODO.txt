NVIM Configuration:
- Don't use ftplugin
- Don't copy keymappings all over the place.
- Creating a package in Java.

Java:
- Would like to fix the issue with Java indentation.
- Ability to run a class from within `nvim`
- `mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=yourpackage.MainClass

Key mappings:
zc, zo, za, zi - folding
Try to see if `Ctrl+f`, `Ctrl+b`, `Ctrl+n`, `Ctrl+p` can work in insert mode
