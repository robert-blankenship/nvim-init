NVIM Configuration:
- Don't use ftplugin
- Don't copy keymappings all over the place.

Java:
- Would like to fix the issue with Java indentation.
- Ability to run a class from within `nvim`
- Ability to quickly import a new class

Key mappings:
zc, zo, za, zi - folding
Try to see if `Ctrl+f`, `Ctrl+b`, `Ctrl+n`, `Ctrl+p` can work in insert mode
